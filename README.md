# College-Link
This project is aimed at increasing competitiveness among students(preferably students of a specific college) by creating a platform for connecting, conversing and competing in various events held worldwide.

College - Link is an android application wherein college students can register, create their profiles, add their skills, connect to other students of various fields and expand their network meanwhile forming a perfect team for their next competition! Being unaware of any upcoming event is out of the question now!
